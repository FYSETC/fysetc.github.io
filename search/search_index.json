Download Vscode + platformio \u00b6 To compile the firmware , you need to install Visual Studio Code and the platformio pulg-in. Download firmware \u00b6 You can download the firmware from Cheetah V11 : https://github.com/FYSETC/Marlin-2.0.x-FYSETC/tree/CHEETAH/V11 Cheetah V12 : https://github.com/FYSETC/Marlin-2.0.x-FYSETC/tree/CHEETAH/V12 And if you want to know what we have changed , we recommend to use git to get the code . Compile the firmware \u00b6 Open Vscode and open platformio main page and click the \"Open Project\" button , and direct to the folder where you put your firmware. If everything goes fine , at the bottom you can see several buttons Just click check mark to compile. If you generate the hex file fail you may need to open vscode using Administrator Account . Upload the firmware(windows,linux,Mac) \u00b6 We provide several ways to upload the firmware .You can just click the upload button to upload the firmware or refer to the two methods below. Upload the firmware(windows) \u00b6 After compiling , you should see the firmware file \"firmware.hex\" in the folder FIRMWARE_LOCATE\\Marlin\\Marlin\\.pio\\build\\STM32F103RC_fysetc\\ Download the flash software in our github https://github.com/FYSETC/STM32Flasher Power the board with power supply and connect the board to your PC with USB cable (This step should before you open the software) Double the click \"FlyMcu.exe\" software to open it. Select Reset@RTS High(>+3v),ISP @DTR High Click \"Port\" to select the port of your USB Select FIRMWARE_LOCATE\\Marlin\\Marlin\\.pio\\build\\STM32F103RC_fysetc\\firmware.hex. At last , \"Start ISP(p)\" to upload the firmware. Upload the firmware(linux) \u00b6 Load usb driver \u00b6 Delete the old version driver /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/ch341.ko rm /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/ch341.ko Download the CH34x driver(linux version) from our github https://github.com/FYSETC/CH340-Driver follow the readme.txt to make and load the driver . If you want the driver load automatically every time your PC power up. You can copy the ch34x.ko file to directory /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/ , and do depmod Install stm32flash tool \u00b6 First get the code git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/stm32flash/code stm32flash-code Then follow the INSTALL file to install the software Upload the firmware \u00b6 Connect the motherboard with USB cable and your PC.

Also, if your board is already installed in the machine, the jumper setting is more inconvenient for you. So, by adding a chip that can solve the problem, why not do it? 2.Why does the USB power flow back to the PSU? \u00b6 At the time of design, we thought that plugging in the USB is just to update the firmware, and at other times you will use the SD card for printing. Even if you use USB printing, it should be a short-time debugging. Even, we found that most of the 2560 boards did the same, and nothing went wrong. This should be a way of testing over time. Until TH3D promotes this problem in the whole world, I think this will cause confusion for many people, so I will solve this problem whether or not it will cause problems, and it was already solved on the 1.2a version. 3.The direction of the encoder is wrong\uff1f \u00b6 First of all, this is not a hardware problem, we can adjust it through software, and it is very easy. Secondly, there is no fixed standard in this direction, and different people may not like the same. Finally, we have changed to the most favorite way, if you want to reverse, you can also set the firmware yourself. Note: In fact, our price is only the price of a hardware platform, we have never calculated the value of software, we think that as one of the contributors and users of marlin, we should follow the spirit of open source, make more people easier Get the convenience of open source. Instead of selling it with open source resources. 4.The screen displays garbled characters\uff1f \u00b6 First of all, we should know that low-voltage signals are easily interfered, so we should try to avoid the screen line and the high-voltage and high-current lines being too close. In addition, our people usually have static electricity on their hands, and directly touch some electronic components, which may also affect normal signal transmission. So if it is just an accidental phenomenon and it will disappear after re-power, then don't worry. If it has been there, please contact us and we will deal with it according to the specific situation! 5.Y-motor got very hot \u00b6 Actually there is an inappropriate firmware configuration. You need to change #define CHOPPER_TIMING CHOPPER_DEFAULT_12V to #define CHOPPER_TIMING CHOPPER_DEFAULT_24V 6.Can't save config to eeprom \u00b6 This is a firmware issue that has been fixed so far, you can fix it by upgrading the firmware. For new firmware,the default config is not for cheetah board anymore as we have other boards to release and the need to build the firmware, you need to change default_envs to fysetc_STM32F1 in platformio.ini file and replace the configuration.h and configuration_adv.h file with FYSETC example config. We will continue to update, please look forward to it!* Tech Support \u00b6 Please submit any technical issue into our forum","title":"FYSETC Cheetah"},{"location":"Cheetah_Board/#product-introduction","text":"Designed for a single-head 3D printer, many interfaces are reserved for more features.

Firmware \u00b6 5.1 Marlin \u00b6 Follow the steps below to compile the firmware yourself. More information here . 5.1.1 Download Vscode + platformio \u00b6 To compile the firmware , you need to install Visual Studio Code and the platformio pulg-in. 5.1.2 Firmware config \u00b6 You have two code source choices Source 1 \u00b6 You can get Marlin code is in the firmware/Marlin folder in this repository github or gitee . Source 2 \u00b6 Also you can get upstream branch from github or gitee (You'd better use the bugfix-2.0.x version as i just make PR 2021/10/10, so Marlin group may not integrate the code in formal version). Remember to change default_envs in platformio.ini file. default_envs = FYSETC_CHEETAH_V20 And change MOTHERBOARD define according to your cheetah board version in Configuration.h #define MOTHERBOARD BOARD_FYSETC_CHEETAH_V20 And serial port #define SERIAL_PORT -1 #define BAUDRATE 115200 Change configuration \u00b6 You need to modify your configuration.h and configuration_adv.h according to your machine. Then you can compile the firmware. 5.1.3 Compile the firmware \u00b6 Open Vscode and open platformio main page and click the \"Open Project\" button , and direct to the folder where you put your firmware. If everything goes fine , at the bottom you can see several buttons Just click check mark to compile. 5.1.4 Upload the firmware \u00b6 Follow the instruction here . 5.2 Klipper \u00b6 Till now(2021/11/30), Klipper don't have boot offset setting for STM32F401 chip, so we use no Bootloader option first. (If you want still want to use Cheetah bootloader, you can change the code following the PR here , then use 32KiB bootloader option). make clean make Then follow the Firmware Upload section instruction below to upload the firmware. I made the PR for Klipper of Cheetah v2.0 config, you can check it here . 5.3 Firmware Upload \u00b6 We provide several ways to upload the firmware. 5.3.1 Upload the firmware(SDCARD) \u00b6 If you use Klipper firmware with No bootloader option, you can't use this method. This method only works with bootloader. Uploading firmware using SD card is our default way to update the firmware as Cheetah v2.0 already has the bootloader on it when it leave the factory. But if you once upload the firmware to Cheetah v2.0 flash address 0x08000000 , then the bootloader in Cheetah v2.0 will be gone, then you need to upload the bootloader to Cheetah v2.0 yourself, please follow the README in bootloader folder ( github or gitee ) to upload the bootloader. How to upload firmware with bootloader \u00b6 Copy your compiled firmware file firmware.bin (If you use klipper firmware, you need to rename klipper.bin to firmware.bin ) file to the SD card , and insert it to the SD card slot which is at the right side of the board, and then power up the board. You may need to wait for about 30s to finish uploading. When finished firmware name will change to old.bin . 5.3.2 Upload the firmware(dfu-util) \u00b6 This method works in linux, that means should work in raspberry pi.

The controller speed is up to 240MHz, 16M flash.

If you run a printing farm and want to be able to start prints remotely via Wi-Fi, this board is for you. Native Wi-Fi support \u00b6 FYSETC E4 is based on the ESP32 microcontroller, so the E4 supports 802.11 b/g/n protocols, and a custom fork of Marlin firmware can be used on the board to allow the board to be controlled via a web browser. This removes the need for the traditional LCD controllers that most other boards use. There is also no need to connect a Raspberry Pi in order to control the printer via a web interface. The web interface is the popular ESP3D webUI, which runs natively on the custom Marlin fork. The printer can then be controlled via any web browser, be it a PC, smart phone, or tablet. For example, you can slice your 3D model using a slicing software on your PC, then use your PC's web browser to connect to the printer, send the sliced GCODE file to the printer via Wi-Fi. Then, using the same web browser, you can tell the printer to start printing away. Trinamic stepper drivers \u00b6 FYSETC E4 use the latest ,best stepper drvier : TMC2209. Ultra quiet Good heat dissipation Max current up to 2A Large heat sink,good heat dissipation Support sensorless-homing function. High voltage for probes \u00b6 One common problem when using inductive or capactive probes is the voltage which they are powered at. These probes are usually connected to the Z endstop, which is powered directly by the microcontroller. This means 5V or 3.3V, but these probes are not designed for such low voltages. Instead, they are usually designed for operation at 6V or more. Using a lower voltage to operate such probes reduces their detection distance, and therefore their effectiveness. The FYSETC E4 has a dedicated connector for such a Z probe which uses the voltage of the power supply to power the probe. If you are using 12V for the power supply, the probe will be running on 12V, and vice versa for when using a 24V power supply. This allows the probe to operate within its specifications, delivering optimal detection distances. Onboard or External Antenna \u00b6 There are two versions of the E4 board. One is that the antenna of the WiFi module is onboard. And the other is a WiFi module with an external antenna. This option give you the choice that if you want to install board in a closed box, the external antenna can avoid the problem of WIFI signal weakening in a confined space.

Reset the FYSETC E4. It should now connect to your router. Connect the USB cable to E4 and your PC with 115200 baudrate, and send Serial command \"[ESP111]\" to get the E4 IP address. Use your web browser and visit the IP address you just get to access the web interface. You can now update the firmware. Download the custom fork from here , edit Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h to suit your needs, then compile. In PlatformIO, you can add \"upload_port = ip adderrs of your E4\" to your platformio.ini file to allow OTA updates.

Different drive modules require different jumpers. The following is a detailed description: As shown in the schematic diagram above, there are three sets of jumpers in the drive section: JP1, JP6, and JP8. The different driver correspondences are shown in the following table: Divers Class Used jumpers A4988/DRV8825/THB6128/LV8729 JP6\uff08only ABC ways\uff09 TMC2100 JP6\uff08only AB ways\uff09 TMC2208 JP1\uff08Short 2&3\uff09& JP6 TMC2130 JP1\uff08Short 1&2\uff09& JP8\uff08Short All\uff09 1- A4988 and similar series \u00b6 If you use the normal A4988 series module, you only need to set the jumper according to the position shown in the figure above, and you should not insert any jumpers in the shaded green part. 2-TMC2100 \u00b6 If you use the TMC2100 module and want to change its microsteps and mode settings, first you must ensure that the CFG1 and CFG2 of the 2100 module are connected by a pin next to it. (For the FYSETC version, you can only perform the welding configuration on the board. The default CFG1 And CFG2 is not connected to the pin header, and the connected version will be sold later) 3-TMC2208 \u00b6 If you use the TMC2208, there are two modes to choose . FYSETC's 2208 is factory defaulted to standalone mode. At this mode, you can only set the microsteps by MS1 and MS2. If you want to config more , you need to enable PDN. First, You must make the jumper next to the PDN pin closed, and second, make sure that the 2 and 3 pin of the JP1 jumper next to the drive position on F6 board is connected , and then, you can make the configuration of the 2208 with marlin (SoftwareSerial). 4-TMC2130 \u00b6 If you use the TMC2130, you should use the SPI mode. FYSETC has a version specifically for F6. The jumper settings on the motherboard are as shown above, and the shaded green part is not used. If you want to use the sensorless endstop function of the 2130, you also need to connect the jumper next to the limit switch socket. The corresponding position of each switch is: X- = X, X+ = E2, Y- = Y, Y+ = E1, Z- = Z, Z+ = E0, then configure the firmware, you can use all the features of the 2130.

If you only use one of the sockets, the other must be connected with a jumper cap, otherwise a Z-axis motor will not work. 1.Stepper drivers \u00b6 In order to support as many different drivers as possible, S6 sets a lot of jumper positions. Different drive modules require different jumpers. As shown in the schematic diagram, there are 2 sets of jumpers in the drive section: JP1 and JP6. In order to give you a better understanding of how to use jumpers for different drivers, I have further illustrated the driver socket. The basic definition of the driver pins is the same, the difference lies in the four places of JP6-1, JP6-2, JP6-3 and JP6-4. You can see their role from the schematic. A4988 jumper config \u00b6 For A4988, A4988 similar, TMC2100 and TMC standalone Mode, You need jumper JP6 (1234-5678) to config the micro-steps, and some TMC features. When you connect the jumper cap, this pin is high. When you are not connected, it is the level state of the module itself. This is different from F6, which can be either high or low. For details, please refer to the corresponding driver description. UART mode config \u00b6 For TMC2208/2225/2209. You just need one jumper to close the JP1, Then the UART mode will enabled. You can config all the feature of the TMC chip via UART, so you can leave all the other jumpers empty. Even for 2209, We give 2 lines UART interface to every driver, so no need config the address by MS1/MS2. TMC2209 wiring \u00b6 SPI mode config \u00b6 For TMC2130/5160/5161. You need 4 jumpers to close the JP6, Then the SPI mode will enabled. 2.12V/24V jumpers \u00b6 S6 have 12V onboard, Fan and RGB jumpers can refer to this picture and the silk screen at the bottom of the board. The input power supply voltage should EXCEED 15v ,if not, the output voltage of 12V DCDC circuit will lower than 12v Never let the 12V current exceed 5A, otherwise it will burn out the 12V DCDC circuit. If you use an input above 18V, you will get a satisfactory 12V output, otherwise the output may be less than 12V. 3.DIAG jumpers \u00b6 If you use a TMC driver with sensor-less homing(2130/2209/5160/5161), you can connect these jumpers so that the MCU can get the DIAG signal through the corresponding end-stop pin to achieve sensor-less. After connect the jumper, remember define the DIAG pins in the firmware and enable the feature. 4.Bottom jumpers \u00b6 X+ / Y+ / Z+ , You can choose 5V or 3.3V, For X+ & Y+, the default is 3.3V. For Z+, The default is 5V, You can connect BLtouch here. X- / Y- / Z- , You can choose 24V or 3.3V, the default is 3.3V. You can switch to 24V, if you want to use some inductive or capacitive sensors. I2C pins, You can choose 5V or 3.3V, the default is 3.3V. For TE0-TE2, You can cut the jumper if you want use a thermocouple temperature measurement through AD597. 5. Jumper for 5V \u00b6 S6 V2.0 version adds 5V selection jumper. You can choose 5V from USB or DC circuit. 6. Jumper for Boot0 \u00b6 In S6 V2.0, the BOOT0 button is replaced by a jumper. Pin Definition \u00b6 All the pins we have marked on the back of the board, if you need to, you can confirm the board in reverse or check the sch. Thanks to the power of the STM32, each pin has multiple functions, I will identify it for your reference as much as possible. For further information, please refer to the STM32F446 datasheet, which I have placed on our S6 GitHub EXP1&EXP2 \u00b6 Eedstops and UART1 Pins \u00b6 The UART socket next to the limit switch can be used to connect serial devices such as the wifi module, or to update the firmware through the serial port. BL-touch Wiring Example \u00b6 Reuse RGB ports for FAN \u00b6 Firmware \u00b6 Marlin \u00b6 Download Vscode + platformio \u00b6 To compile the firmware , you need to install Visual Studio Code and the platformio pulg-in.

How to use \u00b6 1.1 Set the jumpers \u00b6 Then insert it to the socket. 1.2 Firmware setting \u00b6 1.2.1 Klipper firmware \u00b6 SSH into your RaspberryPi and edit your printer.cfg file using nano . Remove any old thermistor configuration under [extruder]. (sensor_type, sensor_pin, etc.) Under [extruder] add these lines: sensor_type: MAX31865 sensor_pin: PD11 # I pulg into Spider E4-MOT socket, `cs` pin is the sensor pin spi_speed: 4000000 spi_software_sclk_pin: PE12 spi_software_mosi_pin: PE14 spi_software_miso_pin: PE13 rtd_nominal_r: 100 rtd_reference_r: 430 rtd_num_of_wires: 2 # Edit it according to the wires count of your PT100 sensor, like `3` or `4`. If you are in EU or any 50 Hz country add this line: rtd_use_50Hz_filter: True Save your changes by typing CTRL+X, Y, [ENTER]. Send FIRMWARE_RESTART from the console in Octoprint and test! It should work. Run PID tuning. PT100 readings will be different from your previous thermistor. For the best thermal accuracy, follow this to PID tune: 1. Heat your bed to 100C. 2. Move your hothend to the center and 5-10 mm above bed 3. Set fans to 25%: \"M106 S64\" 4. Run: \"PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=extruder TARGET=245\" 5. This will run for a few minutes. When finished, save with: \"SAVE_CONFIG\" 1.2.2 Marlin firmware \u00b6 Step 1: Change pins file \u00b6 Add the follow lines to pins_FYSETC_SPIDER.h before #endif line. #define Thermo_SCK_PIN PE12//SCK #define Thermo_do_PIN PE13//MISO #define Thermo_CS1_PIN PD11//CS1 E4_CS_PIN #define Thermo_CS2_PIN -1//CS2 #define MAX31865_MOSI_PIN PE14 #define MAX6675_SS_PIN Thermo_CS1_PIN #define MAX6675_SS2_PIN Thermo_CS2_PIN #define MAX6675_SCK_PIN Thermo_SCK_PIN #define MAX6675_DO_PIN Thermo_do_PIN You need to change Thermo_CS1_PIN to related cs if you insert PT100Stick to other stepper driver socket.

Otherwise, the drive module may burn out. 5.2.1 Solder Jumper \u00b6 QHV5160 working mode selection is base on the voltage present on Pin21 and Pin22(Integrated pull down resistor). Pin21 is fix to 3.3v(use 1 to represent 3.3v), so working mode is decided by Pin22 only. Pin22 is on the middle pad2 on JP1 below, by default it is connected to pad1, so according to the chart below, the default working mode is SPI Mode . If you want change to Standalone Mode , you need a knife to cut the line(you can't see it, it is under solder mask layer) between pad1 and pad2, and connect pad2 and pad3(solder it).

Choose one you need. 4.1 Marlin \u00b6 4.1.1 Download Vscode + platformio \u00b6 To compile the firmware , you need to install Visual Studio Code and the platformio pulg-in. 4.1.2 Download firmware \u00b6 The Marlin firmware is in the firmware/Marlin folder in this repository , you can also get the firmware from latest Marlin bugfix-2.0.x branch . You need to enable following define in configuration.h file #define MOTHERBOARD BOARD_FYSETC_SPIDER #define SERIAL_PORT -1 Then we need to change platformio.ini file default_envs = FYSETC_S6 (For old bootloader,boot address is 0x10000 , see below) default_envs = FYSETC_S6_8000 (For new bootloader,boot address is 0x8000 , see below) Note: The bootloader boot address have been change to 0x08008000 since 2021/06/23, you can check bootloader details github or gitee , and you can check the Marlin PR here . 4.1.3 Compile the firmware \u00b6 Open Vscode and open platformio main page and click the \"Open Project\" button , and direct to the folder where you put your firmware. If everything goes fine , at the bottom you can see several buttons The check mark is for compiling , click it to compile. You can find built firmware.bin at .pio\\build\\FYSETC_S6 or .pio\\build\\FYSETC_S6_8000 folder. 4.1.4 Upload firmware \u00b6 Follow Firmware Update guide here . 4.2 Klipper \u00b6 We put Klipper related files like printer.cfg in firmware/Klipper folder in this repo. Please read the README there. If you want to use Klipper. You need to follow the Klipper installation guide to install Klipper first. When we try to compile it, we need to call make menuconfig to choose compile options, please select options for Spider as below describe. 4.2.1 menuconfig \u00b6 Please choose these options for Spider, you need to decide which to choose according to your board and wiring on some options. Enable extra low-level configuration options \u00b6 Micro-controller Architecture \u00b6 Select STMicroelectronics STM32 Processor model \u00b6 Select STM32F446 Clock reference \u00b6 Select 12 MHz crystal Bootloader offset \u00b6 32KiB bootloader \u00b6 If you choose 32kiB bootloader offset in Klipper make menuconfig . Then you need to flash the spider board bootloader named Bootloader_FYSETC_SPIDER first(If you get your Spider board after 2021/06/23 , no worries, the bootloader is on the board when it leave the factory, if not, flash it first). The bootloader is in the folder named bootloader in this repo, please follow the README in bootloader folder( github or gitee ) to flash the bootloader. We provide pre-build firmwares with 32KiB bootloader named klipper-32k-USB.bin and klipper-32k-UART.bin for you,find them here github gitee . These pre-build firmware will be outdated if Klipper update and will not match your new downloaded Klipper and cause annoying issues. We will try to catch up with Klipper, but i recommend to build the firmware yourself. Communication interface \u00b6 You have two choices here, if you use USB cable to connect RaspeberryPI and Spider, you need to check 1. USB (on PA11/PA12) . If you use serial to connect RaspberryPI and Spider, then check 2. Serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9) . 1. USB (on PA11/PA12) \u00b6 If you want to connect Spider to RaspberryPI with USB cable. You need to select USB (on PA11/PA12) And in printer.cfg you need to set the serial as below. We provide an example cfg file printer.cfg for VORON 2 machine here . Obtain definition by \"ls -l /dev/serial/by-id/\" then unplug to verify ##-------------------------------------------------------------------- serial: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_stm32f446xx_230032000851363131363530-if00 2. Serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9) \u00b6 If you want to connect Spider UART1(RX1:PA10, TX1:PA9) port to RPI uart0(TX:GPIO14,RX:GPIO15) port, you need to select Serial (on USART1 PA10/PA9) In printer.cfg you need to uncomment the following line as our example printer.cfg file here ( github gitee )do, if your cfg file don't have this line, please add it. serial: /dev/ttyAMA0 Besides this make option, you still need to follow the instructions that Connect RPI uart.md file says, you can find the file github or gitee . 4.2.2 Compile firmware \u00b6 make 4.2.3 Upload firmware \u00b6 Follow Firmware Update guide here . 4.3 RRF \u00b6 As RRF firmware requires more than 512KB of Flash space, the Spider equipped with 446 cannot meet its requirements. So it needs to disable some features to make it work, please check the README in firmware/RRF folder github gitee . 4.4 Firmware Upload \u00b6 We provide several ways to upload the firmware including SDCARD, dfu-util, DFU and platformio. 4.4.1 Upload the firmware(SDCARD) \u00b6 Uploading firmware using SD card is our default way to update the firmware as Spider already has the bootloader in it when it leave the factory. But if you once upload the firmware to Spider flash address 0x08000000 , then the bootloader in Spider will be gone, then you need to upload the bootloader to Spider yourself, please follow the README in bootloader folder ( github or gitee ) to upload the bootloader. Uploading firmware using SD card: copy your compiled firmware file firmware.bin (If you use klipper firmware, you need to rename klipper.bin to firmware.bin ) file to the SD card , and insert it to the SD card slot which is at the right side of the board, and then power up the board. You may need to wait for about 30s to finish uploading, there is LED beside the sdcard slot blinking when it is uploading. 4.4.2 Upload the firmware(dfu-util) \u00b6 This method works in linux, that means should work in raspberry pi. Step 1. Enter DFU mode first \u00b6 First power off the board Set jumper on 5V pin and DC5V Place jumper on BT0 to 3.3V pin Connect USB cable to the board and your computer Power up the board with 24v Now the board is in DFU mode. If not, click the reset button. Also you can power on the board with 5v, but you need to set jumper on 5V and USB5V (Check the silkscreen lable on the back of the board) but not on 5V and DC5V. REMEMBER to remove BT0 jumper if you finish uploading firmware or it will enter DFU mode again. Step 2. Install dfu-util \u00b6 Make sure dfu-util is installed, shoot dfu-util --version command to check. Sample output: dfu-util 0.9 Copyright 2005-2009 Weston Schmidt, Harald Welte and OpenMoko Inc. Copyright 2010-2016 Tormod Volden and Stefan Schmidt This program is Free Software and has ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY Please report bugs to http://sourceforge.net/p/dfu-util/tickets/ If not , you should install it first, use the package manager of your distribution to get the latest version, like sudo apt-get install dfu-util Step 3. Use command to upload firmware \u00b6 Then use the command below to upload the firmware. You should replace firmware.bin below with your built firmware bin(or hex) file location like out/klipper.bin . Change flash address 0x08008000 to bootloader you choosed. (If you use Marlin firmware and your platformio env is default_envs = FYSETC_S6 , then you need to set it to 0x08010000 , if env is default_envs = FYSETC_S6_8000 , then you need to set it to 0x08008000 . If you use klipper firmware and you choose boot address No bootloader when compiling then set it 0x08000000 , if 32kiB bootloader , set it 0x08008000 . if 64KiB bootloader set it to 0x08010000 .If yours is hex file, set it 0x08000000 ). dfu-util -R -a 0 -s 0x08008000:leave -D firmware.bin 4.4.3 Upload the firmware(DFU) \u00b6 The other way to upload the firmware is using DFU. Step 1. Download stm32cubeprogrammer \u00b6 You can download it from ST website. https://www.st.com/zh/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html Open the STM32CubeProgrammer software. Step 2. Enter DFU mode \u00b6 First power off the board Set jumper on 5V pin and DC5V Place jumper on BT0 to 3.3V pin Connect USB cable to the board and your computer Power up the board with 24v Now the board is in DFU mode. If not, click the reset button. Also you can power on the board with 5v, but you need to set jumper on 5V and USB5V (Check the silkscreen lable on the back of the board) but not on 5V and DC5V. REMEMBER to remove BT0 jumper if you finish uploading firmware or it will enter DFU mode again. Step 3. Upload the firmware \u00b6 Now you can connect and flash the Spider board with stm32cubeprogrammer with the following operation. Do as the red number shows in the screen shot. Click the button to find the DFU port. Connect the DFU Choose the \"firmware.bin\" file. (or .hex file). Fill in the 'Start address' (If you use Marlin firmware and your platformio env is default_envs = FYSETC_S6 , then you need to set it to 0x08010000 , if env is default_envs = FYSETC_S6_8000 , then you need to set it to 0x08008000 . If you use klipper firmware and you choose boot address no bootloader when compiling then set it 0x08000000 , if 32kiB bootloader , set it 0x08008000 . if 64KiB bootloader set it to 0x08010000 . If yours is hex file, don't need to set anything). Start Programming 4.4.4 Upload the firmware(platformio) \u00b6 If you compile Marlin yourself with platformio,you can follow the instructions below to upload the firmware. Step 1. Enter DFU mode first \u00b6 First power off the board Set jumper on 5v pin and DC5V Place jumper on BT0 to 3.3V pin Connect USB cable to the board and your computer Power up the board with 24v Now the board is in DFU mode. If not, click the reset button. Also you can power on the board with 5v, but you need to set jumper on 5V and USB5V (Check the silkscreen lable on the back of the board) but not on 5V and DC5V. REMEMBER to remove BT0 jumper if you finish uploading firmware or it will enter DFU mode again. Step 2. Click the upload button to upload firmware \u00b6 4.5 Test firmware \u00b6 If you suspect there is something wrong with your board, you can use our test firmware to have a test. Follow the README here ( github gitee ). 5. Issue shot \u00b6 5.1 Spider 3.3v issue \u00b6 Please check here( github gitee ). 5.2 TMC2209 connection issue \u00b6 Fix 1 : Please add a jumper on each TMC2209 on your Spider board. And restart the machine again. Fix 2: Try to shoot Klipper command INIT_TMC STEPPER=<name> name can be stepper_x , stepper_y and other stepper in your printer.cfg . 5.3 firmware.bin not changed to old.bin \u00b6 Fix 1: Reflash the bootloader, follow the instruction here ( github gitee ). Fix 2: If you use Klipper firmware, choose No bootloader option when compiling, and upload the firmware to 0x08000000 flash address.

The maximum settable motor current is 1.77A RMS (0.11Ohm sense resistors), but the SilentStepSticks can only be used up to 1.2A RMS. Irms = (Vref * 1.77A) / 2.5V = Vref * 0.71 Vref = (Irms * 2.5V) / 1.77A = Irms * 1.41 = Imax Vref -> Voltage on Vref pin Irms -> RMS (Root Mean Square) current per phase (Irms = Imax / 1.41) Imax -> Maximum current per phase (Imax = Irms * 1.41) Note \u200b 1.Vref measures G nd and the voltage at the middle of the potentiometer. \u200b 2.Do not connect the motor when measuring the voltage, otherwise it is easy to burn the driver. \u200b 3.Power should be connected when measuring voltage, do not just connect USB power supply. \u200b 4.

Motor Current Setting \u00b6 The best way to set the motor current is by measuring the voltage on the Vref pin (0\u20262.5V) and adjusting the voltage with the potentiometer. The maximum settable motor current is 1.77A RMS (0.11Ohm sense resistors), but the SilentStepSticks can only be used up to 1.2A RMS. Irms = (Vref * 1.77A) / 2.5V = Vref * 0.71 Vref = (Irms * 2.5V) / 1.77A = Irms * 1.41 = Imax Vref -> Voltage on Vref pin Irms -> RMS (Root Mean Square) current per phase (Irms = Imax / 1.41) Imax -> Maximum current per phase (Imax = Irms * 1.41) Note \u200b 1. Vref measures Gnd and the voltage at the middle of the potentiometer. \u200b 2. Do not connect the motor when measuring the voltage, otherwise it is easy to burn the driver. \u200b 3. Power should be connected when measuring voltage, do not just connect USB power supply. \u200b 4. Please pay special attention to directions!

Hardware Connection \u00b6 You can use every RS232 serial adapter with 0-5V logic levels (e.g. FTDI-Breakout) and the SilentStepStick Tester/Programmer can be used as connection adapter. Tip \u200b The jumper next to the PDN_UART pin has to be closed on the TMC2208 SilentStepStick to enable the pin access via the pin header.

SPREAD Chopper mode selection: Low=StealthChop, High=SpreadCycle VREF Analog Reference Voltage Interface Resources \u00b6 Wiring Diagram \u00b6 Tip The TMC2225 outputs continuous motor current up to 1.4A and peak current up to 2A. Therefore, the reference voltage of the driver module should not exceed 1V. At the same time, the driver module must be heat dissipated, otherwise it will affect the life of the driver module. Motor Current Setting (Same As TMC2208) \u00b6 The best way to set the motor current is by measuring the voltage on the Vref pin (0\u20262.5V) and adjusting the voltage with the potentiometer. The maximum settable motor current is 1.77A RMS (0.11Ohm sense resistors), but the SilentStepSticks can only be used up to 1.2A RMS. Irms = (Vref * 1.77A) / 2.5V = Vref * 0.71 Vref = (Irms * 2.5V) / 1.77A = Irms * 1.41 = Imax Vref -> Voltage on Vref pin Irms -> RMS (Root Mean Square) current per phase (Irms = Imax / 1.41) Imax -> Maximum current per phase (Imax = Irms * 1.41) Note \u200b 1. Vref measures Gnd and the voltage at the middle of the potentiometer. \u200b 2. Do not connect the motor when measuring the voltage, otherwise it is easy to burn the driver. \u200b 3. Power should be connected when measuring voltage, do not just connect USB power supply. \u200b 4. Please pay special attention to directions!

To run the program: \u00b6 Install ScriptCommunicator Download TMC2208.scez Start the TMC2208.scez file with the ScriptCommunicator: ScriptCommunicator TMC2208.scez Choose the right serial port and click Connect Modifications in the Configurator are directly transmitted Tip \u200b The OTP bits can be programmed only one time. \u200b If you enable spreadCycle then TOFF cannot be 0 (null). Hardware Connection \u00b6 You can use every RS232 serial adapter with 0-5V logic levels (e.g. FTDI-Breakout) and the SilentStepStick Tester/Programmer can be used as connection adapter. Tip \u200b The jumper next to the PDN_UART pin has to be closed on the TMC2208 SilentStepStick to enable the pin access via the pin header. Firmware Setting (Same As TMC2208) \u00b6 You don't need to set the firmware, just need to set the microstep to the firmware through MS2, MS1, usually it is 16 microsteps. If you want use UART mode, Please confirm that your wiring is correct. And then\uff0cyou can perform some column configuration on the driver through firmware. The setup steps are as follows: 1. Wiring \u00b6 For your convenience, we have made adjustments to all the new TMC drivers in the new version. We have added pin headers that extend the board for the position where you may need wiring (SPI or UART). For the UART, we added a 1K resistor to the board, providing RX and TX directly, and you don't need to solder. For F6 or similar boards, please forget the above two points and cut off the extended pin headers, They are of no use to you. Just install it directly on the board, and following the instructions of the board. For the board that needs wiring, please refer to the picture below: 2.

Irms = (Vref * 1.77A) / 2.5V = Vref * 0.71 Vref = (Irms * 2.5V) / 1.77A = Irms * 1.41 = Imax Vref -> Voltage on Vref pin Irms -> RMS (Root Mean Square) current per phase (Irms = Imax / 1.41) Imax -> Maximum current per phase (Imax = Irms * 1.41) Note \u200b 1. Vref measures Gnd and the voltage at the middle of the potentiometer. \u200b 2. Do not connect the motor when measuring the voltage, otherwise it is easy to burn the driver. \u200b 3. Power should be connected when measuring voltage, do not just connect USB power supply. \u200b 4. Please pay special attention to directions!
